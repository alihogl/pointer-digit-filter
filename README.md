This is a straightforward C program implemented to effectively filter out digits of a number based on maximum exposure or repetition. Upon implementation the program applies the principle of using pointers to make the program consume as little resources as possible. 


## Example

- Input number: `4430011`  
- Max allowed repetition: `1`  
- Output: `4301`  
	(Each digit has only appeared once)  


## What you get? 
- Pure C code.
- Pointers implemented efficiently consuming more memory.
- Flexible grouping of numbers dynamically compiled and filtered.

## How does it operate? 

1. The input number is processed based upon digit-by-digit method.
2. A frequency count is used.
3. Each digit is removed when maximum counts exceeds the expected amount.
4. The number is created then printed after the filtration has taken place.
